# SkillForge

SkillForge is an AI-powered career preparation platform designed to help computer science students and professionals interview better and bridge their skill gaps.

## What it does

*   **Mock Exams**: Generates practice tests for different subjects like DSA, SQL, and Networks to test your knowledge.
*   **Mock Interviews**: Simulates a technical interview where you answer questions, and the AI gives you feedback on your confidence, clarity, and areas for improvement.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis**: You input your target job role (e.g., "Frontend Developer") and your current skills. The system analyzes what you are missing and gives you a roadmap to learn those missing skills.
*   **Drift Analyzer**: Tracks your daily study hours and correlates them with your exam scores to measure your "learning velocity." It also warns you if your performance is "drifting" (declining) and tracks how much you rely on AI assistance.
*   **AI Study Assistant**: A chatbot (powered by Google Gemini) that answers technical questions on Data Structures, Algorithms, SQL, and more. It helps explain concepts if you get stuck while studying.
*   **Networking**: A simple feature to connect with other learners on the platform.
